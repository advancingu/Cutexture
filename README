Cutexture is an Open Source library for integrating Qt user interfaces into Ogre3D. It is shipped with a simple example application.


Building
========

Cutexture uses cmake as its build system.

Edit the file 'build/paths.cmake' to reflect the paths on your local system.

In the Cutexture directory, run one the following two commands:

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=”Release”
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=”Debug”

This will set up a release or a debug build of the library.

Now run:

make install

The library will be installed to 'output/lib/debug' or 'output/lib/release' depending on the build type.
The example application will be installed to 'output/bin/debug' or 'output/bin/release' depending on the build type.


Running the example
===================

Under Linux, to run the example after building the code as described above, you need to set the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable to point to the library directory that the Cutexture library was installed into.
