Cutexture is an Open Source library for integrating Qt user interfaces into Ogre3D. It is shipped with a simple example application. Cutexture works by rendering Qt user interfaces into Ogre3D textures. It also provides convenience methods for forwarding mouse and keyboard events from Ogre3D to Qt.

Dependencies
============

Qt 4.6 or later
Ogre3D 1.6 or later
Object Oriented Input System (OIS) 1.2 or later
Cmake 2.6 or later

Building
========

Cutexture uses cmake as its build system.

Edit the file 'build/paths.cmake' to reflect the paths on your local system.

In the Cutexture directory, run one the following two commands:

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=”Release”
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=”Debug”

This will set up a release or a debug build of the library.

Now run:

make install

The library will be installed to 'output/lib/debug' or 'output/lib/release' depending on the build type.
The example application will be installed to 'output/bin/debug' or 'output/bin/release' depending on the build type.


Running the example
===================

Under Linux, to run the example after building the code as described above, you need to set the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable to point to the library directory that the Cutexture library was installed into.


Using Cutexture
===============

Cutexture provides two main classes: UiManager and InputManager

UiManager provides all facilities needed to render Qt user interfaces into Ogre3D textures.

InputManager provides an adapter for passing OIS keyboard and mouse input events to the Qt user interface managed by UiManager. It is however possible to pass these events directly to UiManager, meaning that use of InputManager is optional.
